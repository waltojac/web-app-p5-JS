# web-app-p5-JavaScript

This is a project to practice writing JS and interacting with a MySQL database. The sakilla database was used. 

The commit history is messy due to developing on personal machine, and hosting on GVSU server. Every change I made I had to commit and pull. Also, this expanded on proj4 which was in PHP, but I converted it to JS.
